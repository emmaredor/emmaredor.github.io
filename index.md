Hello, I'm Emma!

I am currently a student at the [Computer Science department of ENS Rennes](https://informatique.ens-rennes.fr/the-department-of-computer-science-and-telecommunications){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and also enrolled in the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} Master's program at Université Paris Cité.

Driven by a keen interest for AI and a lifelong fascination with the complex machinery of the human body, my aspiration is to collaborate with doctors and healthcare professionals to advance our understanding of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s, contributing to new, innovative treatments that can truly make a difference in patients’ lives.

I’m deeply committed to the principles of reproducibility in research. Ethical implications of AI also matter to me, technology should not only push our knowledge boundaries but also respect human & environment.

I’m excited about the future where technology and medicine work hand in hand, and I’m eager to be part of this journey.

I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at [ENS Rennes](http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, driven by a keen interest for AI and a lifelong fascination with the complex machinery of the human body. My aspiration is to collaborate with doctors and healthcare professionals to advance our understanding of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s, contributing to new, innovative treatments that can truly make a difference in patients’ lives.

For me, science isn’t just about discovery—it's about doing so with integrity. I’m deeply committed to the principles of reproducibility in research. Ethical implications of AI also matter to me, technology should not only push our knowledge boundaries but also respect human & environment.

I’m excited about the future where technology and medicine work hand in hand, and I’m eager to be part of this journey.

Hobby-wise, I’ve always had a love for drawing, something I’ve been doing about since middle school. I’m also a bit of a bathroom singer—though I did take my singing beyond the shower, performing in a school musical and even joining the school’s rock band for a while. Both art and music bring give me the creative outlet I need alongside my academic pursuits (creativity is key in research!).
